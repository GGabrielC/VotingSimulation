# VotingSimulation
An algorithm for a fairer and better voting system

About:
Every time we run the code, 1 simulation is displayed (in standard ouput), after being cherry-picked using the function getSatisfactionOfGeneratedBallots.

Language: 
Python3

Output:
The output begins with 3 tables, to show how the algorithm works before deciding the winner. 
The first row and first collumn act as coordinates. Each table has the candidates as first row. 
The first table has preference ranks on the first collumn. In the last two tables, we have stages in staid of preference ranks. 
After the tables, we have results of two algorithms, which are used to select the winner, based on the Score of Candidates Table.

Input:
No input needed.

Command line arguments:
None
